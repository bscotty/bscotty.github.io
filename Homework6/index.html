This folder contains two examples of the use of the M.js matrix library:

<ul>
    <li><a href=tumbling_cube.html>tumbling_cube.html</a> is a tumbling cube.
        <p></p>
    <li><a href=dancing_guy.html>dancing_guy.html</a> is a very skinny person dancing.
</ul>
<p>
    To get these two examples to work properly, you need to properly
    implement the methods in M.js.
